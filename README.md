# GDCP
This is a site created by CodeJevil inspired by the GDDP designed to help people get better at Geometry Dash by playing Challenges rather than Demons.

# Contact
If you would like to contact me, it would be best to do so through my discord, CodeJevilGD#3837.
A Discord Server will be created once v1.0 of the site is released so you can give suggestions, requests, etc.
